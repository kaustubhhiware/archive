My name is Kaustubh Hiware and I am the fastest binge-watcher alive. 
To the outside world , I am a Second Year student studying Computer Science at IIT Kharagpur.
But secretly , with the help of my friends at KGP , I watch ALL their suggested movies and videos at 2x.
I have watched some great movies , but in doing so , I have developed an addiction of binge-watching.

I am the Binge.

Binge .With an E . Because , well no one likes Bing .
